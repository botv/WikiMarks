# WikiMarks
### What is it
WikiMarks is an iOS app allows travelers and curious fellas to take a picture of a landmark and get general and historical information about that landmark. For example, if I was in Rome and had no idea which cathedral I was gawking at, I could use WikiMarks to find out, and maybe even impress my companions with some cool information about it.
### How It Works
WikiMarks is powered by Google ML Kit. For a one week hackathon, this seemed ideal.
### Who Built It
WikiMarks was dreamed up by Ben Botvinick in 2018, and built by Ben Botvinick and Robert May.
